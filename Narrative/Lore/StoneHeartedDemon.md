## Local Legend: The Stone-hearted Demon

A water demon once came to the world of humans to observe our ways.


While here, the demon transformed herself as a human woman and explored the town.
In the town, a man saw her, looking lost and offered to show her around. However,
the demon's human form could only last for a few hours, so she arranged to meet
the man again the next day.


Over the course of many weeks, the demon and the man spent many hours together
and fell in love.


But this was a war-torn time in the world's history and so the man was sent
to fight in battle, where he was killed.


Horrified by the act of war and the senseless loss of her lover, the demon's heart
(which had slowly become more and more human) left her body and turned to stone.
She took to a cave, where she went to sleep in her grief. She placed a curse
around the cave so that any human that entered it would feel her agony.


It is said that humans who enter the cave return cold-hearted and emotionless.


## In Game

The player character has the option of researching this local legend at the library,
where the supposed stone heart is kept in a display case in the museum section.

She can learn of a local who entered the cave and returned unable to love or see
the good in people.

If the player chooses to investigate the cave, she can first place a spell of
magical resistance on herself and avoid the demon's curse.

When the demon senses the resistance to her curse, she awakens, still grieving
and explains that she can never return home as long as her heart lives outside
of her body.

The player can retrieve the heart from the library a few different ways:
- By befriending the librarian
- By befriending the miscreant boy to help her break in.

The heart can be returned to the demon to allow her to return home.
